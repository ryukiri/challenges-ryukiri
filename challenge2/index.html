        Totoro (formally "O Totoro") is the King/Keeper of the Forest in a rural area of Japan. He resides in a large Camphor Tree hidden beyond the thicket near the the Kusakabe family residence. Mei names him Totoro when she mispronounces the word "Troll." He is typically accompanied by smaller spirits called Chu Totoro (medium, blue) and Chibi Totoro (small, white). All three of the Totoro spirits possess spiritual powers attuned to nature and are able to draw the children into the spiritual world. Despite his massive size and monstrous roar, Totoro is a loving protector and helps the Kusakabe girls when they are in need.
