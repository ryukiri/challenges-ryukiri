# Challenge 9 - Group Project

For this assignment, your team will create a web app of your choosing. You can build a new web site for a real client such as a student organization, an artist, a non-profit, or a local business. Or you can build a more sophisticated web application, either for a client or yourselves. What you build is up to you, but there are a few requirements that you must meet.

## Requirements

1.  You must create a new repo in our organization (which you will create in <a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1118281/assignments/3820979" target="_blank">Challenge 8</a>).
2.  You must use branches and pull requests for any code added to your app.
3.  You must use Github Issues to organize and track the work for your app.
4.  You can use existing CSS frameworks and JavaScript libraries, but the rest needs to be your own work. You cannot use a pre-packaged template built by someone else, or any end-user web-site building tools like Wix, Weebly, Squarespace, etc. 
5.  It must work on both desktop and mobile devices.
6.  You should use appropriate fonts, colors, page layout, images, and other media to create an intuitive and engaging user experience.
7.  You **cannot** recreate a challenge from earlier in the quarter. 
8.  It must be hosted somewhere such as Github Pages, Firebase Hosting, or another hosting service.

    2. <a href="https://surge.sh/" target="_blank">Surge</a>
    3. <a href="https://www.heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a>

    5. <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#deployment" target="_blank">Instructions for Create React Apps</a>
9.  Each team member must make a non-trivial code contribution to the app. 
    1.  Optional: you may have **one** member of your team act as a Project Manager. This person will be responsible for managing the completion of the project, including creating and managing Github issues and reviewing code for your project.
    2.  There must be documented evidence (creating issues, commenting on PRs, etc.) of this person's work.
    3.  This person must still make **at least one non-trivial code commit** to the app.

## How to Submit your Assignment

All code for this challenge must be committed to the **master** branch in your team repo, using pull requests. To turn in your challenge, submit the URL to the repo on Canvas. In the `README` of your repo, please include a link to your app where it is hosted (Github Pages, Firebase, etc.).

## Group Project Fair

On December 6, each team will present their project to the class. Everyone will vote on the best projects, and those teams will get extra credit (and maybe some swag)! To keep it fair, there will be the following groud rules:

* All teams must commit and merge any code for their app to their repo by **8:30am sharp**. At that time, we will be cloning all of the team repos to the lab podium computer, so what is in the repo at that time is what will be presented.
* Please don't work while others are presenting.
* Presentations will be limited to 5 minutes.
